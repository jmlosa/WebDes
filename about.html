						<br>
						<br>Hi! I'm Jessa Mae Losa from Manila, Philippines. Now, you might be wondering who Rei is.
						<br>Rei is my cosplay alias/nickname. I go by that name in the cosplay community for security 
						<br>purposes since I get to meet lots of people, aka strangers.
						<br>
						<br>I have been cosplaying since February 2011. So far, I have cosplayed more than 40 characters
						<br>from video games and Japanese animes. My cosplay ranges from loli girls to shota boys,
						<br>most are young-looking characters. Our team are also doing some original concept shoots.
						<br>
						<br>I am cosplaying for the purpose of relieving myself from stress with my daily life. I could also be
						<br>considered as a cosplay hobbyist, but a passionate one. lol I do my best to make my cosplay
						<br>as accurate as possible. From costume to makeup, I always make sure that everything
						<br>is almost on point.
						<br>
						<br>Thanks for visiting my website!
